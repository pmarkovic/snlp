    "1.1 In variable-width code, a word that contains frequently-occuring characters will have a shorter representation. In contrast, the encoding of a word with infrequently-used letters would be significantly larger in size. In this case where a word can contain any character, fixed-width encoding would work better since all characters would be represented by the same number of bits. With a UTF-16 encoded string, compatibility issues with Byte Order Mark (BOM) may arise. BOM is a sequence of unprintable Unicode bytes, placed at the beginning of the text, which makes it easier for compatible applications to determine the subtype of Unicode format and to define the direction for reading the bytes. This often causes compatibility issues because not all applications know how to handle the BOM. For non-compatible applications, this sequence of bytes is considered as some normal characters in extended ASCII. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Installing biopython** <br/>\n",
    "Install [biopython](https://biopython.org/) to your local Python environment. Dependencies should be installed automatically. <br/>\n",

    "2. **Saving data files**  <br/>\n",
    "Download the genome of *Drosophila melanogaster* from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/drosophila-melanogaster-genome?select=genome.fa). For this, you wil need to create an account on kaggle. <br/> \n",
    "To save the data files you download, create a folder called `data` and save the csv and fasta files directly in this folder, since the same path will be used for retrieving the relevant files, as you can see below in the provided code. Conversely, you can simply rename the `archive` folder as `data`. \n",
    "3. **How to read a fasta file**  <br/>\n",
    "As your first task, you have to sample a reduced version of the genome using the pre-implemented `sample_records` function in `exercise_2.py`. The function will write the reduced genome to a [fasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) file. <br/>\n",
    "Biopython can be imported in your Python file with the statement `import Bio`. \n",
    "For reading fasta files, look up how to utilise biopython's SeqIO module for parsing the file structure to read genome information in the form of sequences. The result should be akin to reading a list of sentences from a text file. Check the `sample_records` function for further guidance. \n",
    "4. **Understanding genome sequences** <br/>\n",

    "o The actual sequence of nucleotides (*Seq*) <br/>\n",
    "These sequences comprise chains formed of the same basic building blocks - the nucleotides A, G, C, T. You will observe that these sequences are case sensitive i.e. they contain both uppercase and lowercase chains. We will explicitly tell you what they mean and how to handle them over the course of this exercise. <br/>\n",
    "5. **Processing genome sequences** <br/>\n",
    "We can deal with the obtained sequences as if they were normal Python strings. Your goal is to first combine all these sequences into a continuous string of nucleotides, and then extract k-mers from this final \"text\" corpus.\n",
    "5. **Difference between k-mers and n-grams** <br/>\n",
