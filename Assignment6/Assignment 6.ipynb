    "* MAP estimator allows one to encode domain information by means of a prior, as it makes use of Bayes rule for parameter estimation. Therefore, it helps in circumventing the data sparseness  problem and can be viewed as a smoothing technique that handles OOV words.  In contrast, MLE uses a frequentist data-driven approach. This means, for an OOV word, it would give a probability of 0. If the training data is large enough and incorporates all possible words that a model will encounter during testing, MLE can be used. But since this is highly unlikely, MAP estimator would be a better choice. In fact, MLE can be seen as a special case of MAP when the prior is uniform.\n",
